# ADXL345 I2C demo

### What this example does:
- Read an ADXL345 accelerometer using I2C libraries generated by MPLAB Code Configurator. Axis output is on a 7-segment display driven by a [MAX7219](https://github.com/Cyb3rn0id/MAX7219sz_PIC_lib) and on the UART.

### Notes:
- SW0 is used to cycle single axe visualizazion on display
- Board is configured for working at 3.3V
- Accelerometer is powered Is mandatory from VTG pin (3.3V)
- MAX7219 is powered from VBUS pin. If you want to use only UART, simply do not connect anytighing to MAX7219 ports
- UART configured at 9600-N-8-1

### System settings:
- system clock: 32MHz
