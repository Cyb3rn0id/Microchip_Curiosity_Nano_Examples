Note:  
_MPLAB Xpress PIC16F18446_ was the old name for the actual _PIC16F18446 Curiosity Nano_"_: debugger pinout is different!!!  
Debugger pinout on MPLAB Xpress has 4+4pins, on Curiosity Nano there are 6+6 pins.  
When you connect the old revisions board (MPLAB Xpress), firmware will be updated at first programming. 
I've put the old documents for this board only for historical purposes and because I've a Rev.1 Board. 
If you got the old revision board, keep in mind that debugger pinout is different!
