Note:  
"MPLAB Xpress PIC16F18446" was the old name for the actual "PIC16F18446 Curiosity Nano": debugger pinout is different!!!  
Debugger pinout on MPLAB Xpress has 4+4pins, on Curiosity Nano there are 6+6 pins.  
When you connect the old revisions board (MPLAB Xpress), firmware will be updated at first programming. 
I've put the old documents for this board only for historical purposes since I've the Rev.1 Board. 
So, if you've old revision board, keep in mind that debugger pinout is different!
